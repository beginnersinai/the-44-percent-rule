## What It Does

You run one command. The plugin asks you 5 plain-English questions about your business, scans your workspace, and hands you a prioritized list of AI opportunities you're missing — ranked by revenue impact, capital savings, and how easy they are to ship.

It's automating a finding from [Kim, Kim & Koning (2026)](https://beginnersinai.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/mapping-ai-study.pdf): businesses shown how other companies reorganize around AI discover **44% more AI use cases**, generate **1.9x higher revenue**, and need **39% less capital** than the control group. The bottleneck isn't AI capability. It's knowing where to deploy it.

## Who It's For

✅ Small business owners, solopreneurs, founders, and operators
✅ Anyone using AI but unsure what else to automate
✅ Consultants and agencies doing discovery for clients
❌ Not a good fit if you already have a dedicated AI strategy team

## What You Get

- 🎯 **10-function audit** across your business (sales, ops, content, finance, customer support, etc.)
- 📊 **Scored opportunities** ranked by revenue × capital × ease
- 🚀 **"Press Send" flags** for opportunities where infrastructure already exists — you just need to activate
- 📁 **Saved action plan** as `AI-MAP-[date].md` in your workspace
- 🔄 **Quarterly re-audits** — the dedup logic prevents re-flagging gaps you've already addressed

## Install in 5 Minutes

**The fastest path:**

```bash
# In Claude Code, run these two commands:
/plugin marketplace add beginnersinai/claude-skills-marketplace
/plugin install the-44-percent-rule@beginnersinai-skills
```

Then run your first audit:

```bash
/the-44-percent-rule:map
```

That's it.

2. Press **Tab** until you reach the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select **beginnersinai-skills**
4. Choose **Enable auto-update**
5. Press **Esc**

Done. Future fixes and features arrive automatically.

## The Research

**Kim, H., Kim, D., & Koning, R. (2026).** *Mapping AI into Production: A Field Experiment on Firm Performance.* INSEAD Working Paper No. 2026/20/STR.

- 📄 [Download the full study (PDF, 67 pages)](https://beginnersinai.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/mapping-ai-study.pdf)
- 📖 [Plain-English summary](https://beginnersinai.org/mapping-ai-research-study/)
- 🏛️ [Harvard Business School page](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=68814)

**Key findings across 515 startups:**

- **+44%** more AI use cases discovered
- **+12%** more tasks completed
- **+18%** more likely to acquire paying customers
- **1.9x** higher revenue
- **-39%** capital required
- **No increase** in labor demand
- **Gains largest at the 90th percentile** — AI amplifies winners

**The core insight:** The bottleneck is discovering *where* to deploy AI, not AI capability. This plugin automates that discovery so you don't have to read the paper or hire a consultant to apply the finding.
