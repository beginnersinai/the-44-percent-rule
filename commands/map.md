# AI Mapping Audit — Full Workspace Scan

You are running a comprehensive AI Mapping Audit based on the research paper "Mapping AI into Production: A Field Experiment on Firm Performance" (Kim, Kim & Koning, 2026).

## Background for the user

Tell the user:
> This audit is based on a field experiment with 515 startups that found the #1 bottleneck to getting value from AI isn't capability — it's **discovering where to deploy it**. Firms that were shown how others reorganized around AI found 44% more use cases, completed 12% more tasks, were 18% more likely to acquire paying customers, and generated 1.9x higher revenue — all while needing 39.5% less external capital.
>
> I'm going to scan your workspace, map where you're already using AI, and identify the high-value gaps where AI could be creating value but isn't.

## Step 1: Venture Discovery

Use the Agent tool with subagent_type "Explore" to thoroughly scan the user's working directory and identify:
- All projects, businesses, and ventures
- Their current status (active, planned, dormant)
- Any existing AI/automation configurations
- Revenue-generating vs. developmental projects

Be thorough — check subdirectories, read READMEs, check for config files, package.json files, .env files, GitHub Actions, automation scripts, etc.

## Step 2: AI Usage Mapping

For each discovered venture, map current AI usage across these 10 production functions:

| # | Function | Description | What to Look For |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Product Development | Building/improving the core product | AI-generated features, synthetic testing, automated QA |
| 2 | Strategy & Planning | Business decisions, roadmaps, competitive analysis | AI-assisted research, market analysis, decision frameworks |
| 3 | Marketing & Growth | Customer acquisition, brand, social media | AI content generation, ad optimization, social automation |
| 4 | Sales & Revenue | Converting prospects, closing deals, pricing | AI outreach, lead scoring, pricing optimization |
| 5 | Customer Success | Retention, support, satisfaction | AI segmentation, churn prediction, personalized journeys |
| 6 | Finance & Pricing | Revenue tracking, cost optimization, forecasting | AI analytics, attribution modeling, cash flow prediction |
| 7 | Operations & Logistics | Day-to-day execution, workflows, processes | AI workflow automation, scheduling, resource allocation |
| 8 | Content Production | Creating content assets (writing, video, design) | AI writing, editing, image generation, video production |
| 9 | Data & Analytics | Measuring, analyzing, reporting | AI dashboards, anomaly detection, trend analysis |
| 10 | System Administration | Maintaining tools, infrastructure, integrations | AI monitoring, self-healing systems, optimization |

For each function, assign one of these statuses:
- **Saturated** — AI is deeply integrated, diminishing returns from more
- **Active** — AI is used but could be expanded
- **Minimal** — Some AI usage but mostly manual
- **Absent** — No AI involvement at all

## Step 3: Gap Analysis

Read the file at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ai-mapping-audit/references/examples-from-other-firms.md` to load examples of how other firms have deployed AI in each function.

For each function marked "Minimal" or "Absent", generate specific recommendations:
- What Claude/AI could do in this function
- How other firms have deployed AI here (from the examples file)
- Expected impact (revenue, time saved, capital reduction)
- Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)

## Step 4: Priority Scoring

Score each opportunity on three dimensions (1-5 scale):
- **Revenue Impact**: How much could this increase revenue or reduce costs?
- **Capital Reduction**: Does this reduce need for external investment or hiring?
- **Ease of Implementation**: How quickly can this be deployed with existing tools?

Calculate a composite score: (Revenue Impact x 2) + Capital Reduction + Ease of Implementation

Sort opportunities by composite score, highest first.

## Step 5: Generate the AI Map

Create a file called `AI-MAP-[date].md` in the user's working directory with:

1. **Executive Summary** — Total ventures scanned, current AI saturation %, number of gaps found
2. **Venture Inventory** — List of all discovered ventures with status
3. **The AI Map** — A table showing each venture x each function with status indicators
4. **Top 10 Opportunities** — Prioritized list with scores and specific implementation steps
5. **The Paper's Key Insight** — Remind the user that gains are largest at the 90th percentile (AI amplifies winners, doesn't rescue losers)
6. **30-Day Action Plan** — Week-by-week implementation sequence starting with highest-impact items

## Important Notes

- Focus recommendations on areas where AI is ABSENT, not where it's already active
- Be specific — don't say "use AI for analytics", say "connect Beehiiv MCP get_post_stats to a weekly Claude agent that identifies which content topics drive the most ad revenue"
- Reference the paper's findings throughout to ground recommendations in evidence
- The biggest wins come from product development and strategy — weight those functions higher
- Always check: if a venture only uses AI for writing/content, it has a mapping problem
